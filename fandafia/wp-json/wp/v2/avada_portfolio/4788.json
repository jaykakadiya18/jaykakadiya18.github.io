Bad OnlyFans agencies aim to imprison you and make as much as they can from your OnlyFans business. To ensure you do not fall victim to bad agencies, this article provides you with an in-depth coverage of evidence-based characteristics of bad OnlyFans agencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OnlyFans offers a lifetime chance for beginner and established female models and influencers to earn money from selling exclusive photos and videos. Some female models and influencers have made OnlyFans a full-time job and may entrust agencies to help them manage their accounts. They entrust agencies expecting to receive a great return on their investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good agencies such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/l\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fandafia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have helped <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/success-stories\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">countless models<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> run their OnlyFans business and attain their dreams of earning six figures and above. On the other hand, there are bad agencies that have frustrated female models with no remorse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note down the names of some of the bad agencies outlined in this article and the accusations against them as a reminder of what describes a bad agency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"fusion-button button-flat fusion-button-default-size button-custom fusion-button-default button-2 fusion-button-default-span fusion-button-default-type\" style=\"--button_accent_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_accent_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_border_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_gradient_top_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_top_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);\" target=\"_self\" href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/\"><span class=\"fusion-button-text fusion-button-text-right\">Make an appointment now<\/span><span class=\"fusion-button-icon-divider button-icon-divider-right\"><i class=\"icon-play-solid\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"fusion-image-element \" style=\"--awb-margin-top:20px;--awb-caption-title-size:var(--h2_typography-font-size);--awb-caption-title-transform:var(--h2_typography-text-transform);--awb-caption-title-line-height:var(--h2_typography-line-height);--awb-caption-title-letter-spacing:var(--h2_typography-letter-spacing);\"><span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-1 hover-type-none\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1150\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Bad OnlyFans Agencies2\" title=\"Bad OnlyFans Agencies2\" src=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2.jpg\" data-orig-src=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2.jpg\" class=\"lazyload img-responsive wp-image-4772\" srcset=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271150%27%20height%3D%27800%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%201150%20800%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%271150%27%20height%3D%27800%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2-200x139.jpg 200w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2-400x278.jpg 400w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2-600x417.jpg 600w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2-800x557.jpg 800w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Bad-OnlyFans-Agencies2.jpg 1150w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-orig-sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1150px\" \/><\/span><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-5\"><h2><b>What Does a Bad OnlyFans Agency Do? 8 Things to beware of!<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3><b>1. Does not fulfill its promises<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you sign a contract with an agency, you expect them to live up to their promises as you follow the directives you agreed upon. Good agencies promise you increased financial returns, subscriber base growth, and nurturing, and make an effort to fulfill the promises. Sadly, bad agencies make outlandish claims that they cannot fulfill.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a report provided by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-features\/onlyfans-model-management-industry-exploitation-1073615\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Johnson, through NJAC LLC, promised to help Ari grow her following and increase her OnlyFans earnings. At first, Johnson did help Ari increase her OnlyFans returns, but after some time, Ari realized Johnson was playing her. The manager at the Casino where Ari worked during the Covid-19 pandemic had to ax her due to government shutdowns. She turned to her existing OnlyFans account to make some money. She had not put in effort to acquire a huge following earning her about $3,000 monthly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cora messaged Ari unexpectedly informing her of a manager, Johnson, who could help her earn more. According to Cora, Johnson promised her a $100,000 monthly return and informed Ari that he needed a model to take over an Instagram account of another model who had just left the agency. Ari knew Johnson from numerous media coverages such as Yahoo Finance, Business Insider, and the New York Times. Johnson also had a personal website highlighting himself as a social media marketing guru. Additionally, it looked like Cora earned so much through the help of Johnson. Due to these reasons, and Johnson promising to help Ari grow her OnlyFans and Instagram following, she signed with him.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the first month, Ari was impressed, having received $75,000 from Johnson. Despite the great start, Ari later realized that Johnson did not guide her on how to grow her following. She also started making less income. According to her statement, in an unspecified month, she received $10-$15,000 from a $50,000 earning. Rather than teaching Ari on how to increase her following, Johnson marketed Ari\u2019s content within Instagram meme pages. Johnson responded to Ari\u2019s claims by saying, \u201cof course we advised on strategy.\u201d Ari confronted Johnson concerning the menial amount she received, and Johnson could not provide evidence indicating how he spent the remaining income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morcy, an OnlyFans management agent, promised Lora a top 1% spot but never delivered on his promise. Morcy had approached Lora through Twitter, claiming to be a Veno Management agent, a company that helped influencers and models grow their following. The contract that Lora signed read Bombshell Magazine Limited rather than Veno Management. Basically, she was duped.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Takes a huge cut off your paycheck<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your OnlyFans business should benefit you more than the agency managing it. You own the talent and put yourself in the line of learning, making mistakes, growth, and humiliation, hoping to make it as an OnlyFans creator. Therefore, in case an agency requests for a greater position of your earnings, you should not work with them. If you also work with an agency and notice they are taking more than the agreed percentage, consider terminating the contract or getting a valid explanation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Natasha, she had signed with NJAC, but decided to end her contract indefinitely having received a smaller percentage of income. Natasha signed a contract stating that she would earn 66% of the net income, but received 33% only. Natasha confronted NJAC over the issue and she received spreadsheets indicating that NJAC spent most of her income on ads. Natasha terminated the contract prematurely after realizing that most of the financial calculations did not add up. NJAC also took a huge cut off Ari\u2019s paycheck with no precise explanation. NJAC claimed to have spent the huge cut on ads but could not prove it. Finally, Ari got tired and decided to leave NJAC. Also, Cora left NJAC because the company took a cut of about 60-70 percent from her income.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another model by the name Roxie Sinner lost so much due to her naivety. According to the story she shared with <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she was new to the industry and lost over $16,000 to a man known as Morcy. Roxie, aged 18, received an Instagram direct message from Morcy informing her that he owned a model managing agency, Bombshell. He convinced her to work with him for a 34% cut and he would help her sell on OnlyFans. Roxie took the offer because she had initially received offers asking for a 50% cut. She initially sold premium Snapchat content and wanted to capitalize on the opportunity and move out of her parents\u2019 home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite promising to take a 34% cut, Morcy ended up taking 50% of Roxie\u2019s earnings. Surprisingly, Morcy tried to take control of Roxie\u2019s OnlyFans account and keep all the earnings to himself, but Roxie talked to the OnlyFans representatives and got her account back. In total Morcy deprived Roxie $16,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Does not respect your boundaries<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When creating OnlyFans content, you do define what you offer and do not offer to avoid clashes with your audience over requests you did not fulfill. In case an agency does not follow suit with what you defined as right and wrong, you should avoid that agency. Some of the agencies can force you to create more content even when you are tired and do not want to. Keep off such agencies for your piece of mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jessica sage, a mom and sex-worker had subcontracted the management of her OnlyFans account to an unmentioned agency to help her with her huge following. She had allowed the agency to impersonate her and respond to her subscribers\u2019 messages. Sage informed Rolling Stone that she had to terminate her contract after the agency started suggesting content she could not make to her subscribers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case an agency offers content you cannot make to your subscribers, you risk disappointing and losing them. Most agencies offer custom content so that they can make more and you should be firm when directing what content they can offer on your behalf. Sage left the agency to avoid the repercussions that would follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nelson also had issues making content she was not comfortable with. Her manager persuaded her to make the videos that ended up on ManyVids without her agreeing to it. Her manager profited from the content. He also shared some photos with Nelson\u2019s family and sold foot fetish films to another client. Nelson fired the manager and hired a new one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-news\/onlyfans-creators-unruly-agency-nudity-lawsuit-1320185\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unruly Agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also faces charges from two models, Jessica Quezada, and Sarah Stage for not respecting their boundaries. Quezada claims Unruly included sexually explicit captions within her photos and sent inapt messages to her OnlyFans subscribers containing sexually explicit details. Stage stated that Unruly kept nagging her to produce explicit content yet she informed them she was not comfortable with the idea.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of agencies that demand more content from you even when you are not in the position to provide more. Ari suffered under NJAC because Johnson kept requesting more content from her. She was frustrated and despite the breaks she received, she says at times the requests made were overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Makes it hard for you to terminate the contract at will\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the deal is too good, think twice. Some contracts contain terms and conditions meant to trap you so that the agency keeps benefiting off of your work. These traps push models to seek legal assistance to get out of the contracts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-features\/onlyfans-model-management-industry-exploitation-1073615\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shared Ari\u2019s story depicting how agencies trap female models. After realizing that NJAC LLC was taking too much from her and not benefitting her as promised, she decided to terminate her contract with the agency. Once she sent a termination message to Johnson, NJAC LLC\u2019s owner, he informed her that she could no longer produce content on social media and she would not receive her monthly pay once she terminates the contract. Apparently, the contract had a non-compete clause included in it that barred her from producing content after an early contract termination. Despite Johnson later claiming that he did not mean to threaten Ari and he was doing it under the instructions of a lawyer, the act of sending threats to models shows you that you should go through the termination conditions provided within any contract before signing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natasha is another model who found it hard to leave NJAC NLL because of the non-compete clause. Natasha collided with Johnson due to poor pay and non-transparent invoices and she decided to leave NJAC NLL by informing her subscribers that she will be creating a new account. She received a cease-and-desist order from Johnson claiming she was violating the non-compete clause stated in her contract.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After accusing Unruly and its affiliated company Behave for various reasons, Unruly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.taulersmith.com\/rolling-stone-article-unruly-agency-exploitation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">threatened<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the two models when they wanted to terminate their contracts with the agency. In several other lawsuits filed against Unruly, the threatening pattern kept showing. For example, a model had to regain access to her account because Unruly could not stop reselling her content and profiting out of it despite her dismissing her contract with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some agencies use fees to trap models. A female creator informed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/otilliasteadman\/unruly-contracts-onlyfans-creators-workers\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buzzfeed News<\/span><\/i><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that Behave fined her $300,000 when she tried to leave. Earlier, she had questioned the contract provided to her by Behave, having spotted some inconsistencies, but Behave informed her that the contract existed for sales and Behave would not enforce it. Eventually, Behave charged her a $300,000 fee despite her having questioned their motives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Lacks transparency in its operations\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should not trust an agency that lacks transparency in terms of who they work with, how they handle your account and earnings, and more. Fake agencies do exist and falling prey is easy once you turn a blind eye. A good agency explains the contract clearly and treasures honestly in their operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research the existence and affiliation of any agency before signing with them. NJAC LLC, claimed affiliation to Baddie, a famous Instagram page that helped OnlyFans creators promote themselves. After entrusting NJAC LLC with her OnlyFans account, Ari later realized that NJAC LLC was not affiliated with Baddie. Initially, Johnson, NJAC LLC\u2019s owner, had claimed affiliation to Baddie to lure Ari into signing with him. Johnson had refused to disclose details about Baddie\u2019s and NJAC LLC\u2019s relationship to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He only said that the two shared employees. NJAC LLC also lacked a website for reference in case one needed to counter check their affiliation claims.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid working with agencies that do not provide details plainly when called upon because you might end up accusing the wrong company. Also, the company you accuse might decide to pass the blame to the affiliated company leaving you confused as to whom to blame for your misery. If an agency does not agree to providing you with financial statements for auditing, avoid them. If you have agreed to let an agency control and manage your finances, ensure that the contract allows you access to the financial statements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Ari\u2019s case, she had noticed that her net gain from $50,000 was $10-15,000 and confronted her account manager over the financial crisis. Johnson, the manager, claimed that he utilized most of the income to run ads. Ari requested for the invoices and expenditure breakdown but Johnson declined her request stating they were company secrets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An honest agency should be in the position to provide a copy of the contract to you or publicly for scrutiny. Without a copy of the contract, there is no way to prove whether what your claims or their claims are true and it makes it hard for you to legally sue the agency. Having a copy prevents the Agency from updating your contract and suing you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, when <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> confronted Johnson for having included a non-compete clause within Ari\u2019s contract, he claimed no such clause existed in the contract. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> requested for a copy of the contract and Johnson could not fulfill the request. In such a case, it would have been easier in case Ari had kept a copy of the contract before signing with Johnson.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the boom in the sale of exclusive and explicit content, several agencies claiming to help influencers and models have emerged allowing for anyone to claim that they own an agency without the required experience and skills. Some of the agencies out here are fake and you need to research before entrusting any agency with your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, Morcy ran a fake agency and was able to swindle OnlyFans models. He had created an agency known as Bombshell and claimed to be affiliated with Veno Management, a well-known agency. When <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> asked Veno Management whether they were in any way linked to Morcy, they declined. After doing a search, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> realized that Bombshell, Morcy\u2019s agency, only existed on a Facebook page having three links.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"fusion-button button-flat fusion-button-default-size button-custom fusion-button-default button-3 fusion-button-default-span fusion-button-default-type\" style=\"--button_accent_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_accent_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_border_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_gradient_top_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_top_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);\" target=\"_self\" href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/\"><span class=\"fusion-button-text fusion-button-text-right\">Make an appointment now<\/span><span class=\"fusion-button-icon-divider button-icon-divider-right\"><i class=\"icon-play-solid\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-6\"><h3><b>6. Desires to take control of your earnings<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some agencies change the banking details of their models\u2019 OnlyFans accounts to theirs. This act takes away control from the models and enables the agencies to manipulate the models more. For example, a creator accused Behave agency for changing her banking details to theirs. Other models also accused Unruly agency for the same.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an agency requests for your logins without an explanation, do not provide the login details because they may try to login into your account without your consent. Once they have successfully logged in, they will replace the banking details and you will be at their mercy during pay day. To avoid such an incident, settle on either of these fee agreements with your agency and record the details within the contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Referral sign up\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A referral sign-up payment method only works for new OnlyFans creators or an established creator who would love to start a new account. The manager or agency that refers you only makes about 5-10% of your earnings nothing more nothing less. You do not pay the agency or manager any amount from your pockets. The more you earn, the more they make, therefore, if you can get an agency to agree to this payment term, they will put in more effort to help you earn more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, if you decide to leave the agency, they will continue earning from your content but only the 5-10% not more. This is the only disadvantage with this payment method.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fixed monthly pay\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can decide to set a fixed rate payable to the agency every month. The agency has no right to take more money and you can easily sue them in case they try to take a huge cut because you have evidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a fixed monthly rate system means you might have to pay the agency even when your earnings are low. A fixed monthly rate does not encourage the agency to help you make more income because they will not benefit from the earnings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Percentage-based rate\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the best payment structure you can utilize. You can also manipulate based on the agreement you have with your agency or combine it with the other fee agreement methods such as referral sign up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A percentage-based rate payment structure requires that you decide on a precise percentage of your monthly returns that you will relinquish to the agency. This method encourages the agency to work harder because they will enjoy a greater return once you earn more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the advantages, these methods can harm your returns in case you are an established OnlyFans creator. The agency should not benefit from your hard work. Ensure that the percentage gain received by the agency comes out of the extra return you get having entrusted them with your OnlyFans business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you used to earn $40,000 monthly, only pay the agency for the extra income they bring in. If they increase the earnings to $50,000, calculate the agency\u2019s percentage pay against $10,000 because those are the fruits of their hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. Sells and Re-sells your content without consent<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So much is in line when you start posting content on OnlyFans, NSFW (not safe for work) content especially. Some models prefer to stay anonymous on OnlyFans <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/knowledge-base\/do-i-have-to-show-my-face-on-onlyfans-truth-revealed\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">due to various reasons<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Selling and reselling content without the consent of the model might ruin the reputation of the model. If an agency does not define how they handle their client\u2019s content, avoid them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NJAC NLL\u2019s owner, Johnson, posted Ari\u2019s exclusive sexually explicit photos and videos publicly without her consent. Johnson did apologize, but Ari lost the privilege of selling the content because everyone had access to the content. Additionally, after Ari left NJAC NLL, Johnson impersonated Ari and kept reselling her content. Many of Ari\u2019s subscribers accused her of defrauding them due to Johnson\u2019s acts. Ari had to seek help from an attorney to stop Johnson from reselling her content. It must have taken Ari time to recover her subscriber\u2019s trust after Johnson tainted her reputation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another case, Models accused Unruly Agency and Behave, its affiliated company, for posting their explicit and nude content on OnlyFans without consent. Another model sued Unruly for sharing an explicit video of her on OnlyFans without consulting her first.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some agencies can also resell your content on other platforms. Therefore, you should ensure that the contract you sign protects you against such a damaging event. Roxie\u2019s nude photos and videos appeared on Snapchat courtesy of Morcy, the agency owner she had trusted to manage her accounts. Roxie received the sad news through an anonymous person and confronted Morcy who denied the allegations. Despite denying, Morcy had already damaged the chances of Roxie selling on Snapchat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>8. Uses dishonest recruitment tactics to collect free content from you<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of OnlyFans content is NSFW and subscribers love content from new creators, mostly models. Bad agencies have found ways to collect free content from models, at times without their consent and selling it by impersonating them on OnlyFans. Being aware of the tactics they use will help you protect your content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take care not to provide free content to an agency during the recruitment process. Josie, aged 23, received an invite from a random female OnlyFans creator requesting her for a \u201clike-for-like\u201d promotion session on Twitter. Josie agreed to the request only for the woman to later inform her that Infinite Possibilities, a modeling agency, was offering an opportunity for models to feature in a 3D holographic magazine. The woman directed her to Russel Andrey, the supposed CEO. Josie took the chance and contacted Andrey through WhatsApp. The two got talking and according to Josie, Andrey wanted her to make a one-minute clip of her putting on \u201cminimal clothing.\u201d Andrey requested her to give him a positive Google review on his portfolio and suggested they have a FaceTime training of which Josie went ahead to attend.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the training Josie realized that Andrey aimed to collect free content after asking her to go get her toys and display her talent and skills while they were on the FaceTime call. She confronted Andrey and declined his requests. Josie later informed a friend about her experience with Andrey and her friend informed her that Andrey was among agency owners defrauding OnlyFans creators.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the incidence, Josie kept hearing of how many newbie female models attended training sessions that collected free content from the models. Many of the agencies would promise success and riches to the unsuspecting models through proper training only to defraud them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Do Fandafia Agency\u2019s Models Have to Say About the Agency?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Success takes time, effort, and a great team.

She also made $500 a month only. She also found it hard to make money through direct messages.
