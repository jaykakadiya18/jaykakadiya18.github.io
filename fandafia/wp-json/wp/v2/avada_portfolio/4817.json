Posting on YouTube as an OnlyFans Creator<\/h1><\/h2><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-3\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Estimated Reading Time:<\/strong> 3 min 41

No, YouTube\u2019s community rules are against posting any content that promotes porn including links to pornographic sites. But, if you were to search YouTube using specific keywords such as, \u201cHow to put on a condom?\u201d You will be surprised by the sheer amount of sexually explicit results you will find. To view the results, you must first agree to being 18 plus and sign in to your Google account. So, why the contrary finding?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you dig in and read more articles, you will realize that to some extent, YouTube does allow explicit content as long as it serves a specific educational purpose. Despite this, some OnlyFans creators who create educational but sexually-explicit content have found it hard to thrive because most of their posts are pulled down after some time. So, what could be the issue?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the OnlyFans creators whose YouTube content has been taken down claim that they included an OnlyFans link alongside their content. But, once they replaced the link with those generated from third parties, they were able to continue posting with no issue. Although, some still kept experiencing continued content take downs due to using Linktree links.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to some OnlyFans creators trying out YouTube as a marketing channel, they find it hard to thrive simply because they create content for a platform (OnlyFans) that is frowned upon by society. In that case, some of them tend to give up posting on YouTube.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some models have created numerous YouTube content but have not found success. If you are among the many OnlyFans models who have found it hard making it on YouTube, do not give up. <\/span><b>Avoid losing fans by not committing these 10 biggest mistakes while posting on YouTube as an OnlyFans creator.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<\/div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"fusion-button button-flat fusion-button-default-size button-custom fusion-button-default button-2 fusion-button-default-span fusion-button-default-type\" style=\"--button_accent_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_accent_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_border_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_gradient_top_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_top_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);\" target=\"_self\" href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/\"><span class=\"fusion-button-text fusion-button-text-right\">Make an appointment now<\/span><span class=\"fusion-button-icon-divider button-icon-divider-right\"><i class=\"icon-play-solid\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"fusion-image-element \" style=\"--awb-margin-top:20px;--awb-caption-title-size:var(--h2_typography-font-size);--awb-caption-title-transform:var(--h2_typography-text-transform);--awb-caption-title-line-height:var(--h2_typography-line-height);--awb-caption-title-letter-spacing:var(--h2_typography-letter-spacing);\"><span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-1 hover-type-none\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1150\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Onlyfans - 10 YouTube Mistakes\" title=\"Onlyfans &#8211; 10 YouTube Mistakes2\" src=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2.jpg\" data-orig-src=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2.jpg\" class=\"lazyload img-responsive wp-image-4816\" srcset=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271150%27%20height%3D%27800%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%201150%20800%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%271150%27%20height%3D%27800%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2-200x139.jpg 200w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2-400x278.jpg 400w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2-600x417.jpg 600w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2-800x557.jpg 800w, https:\/\/fandafia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Onlyfans-10-YouTube-Mistakes2.jpg 1150w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-orig-sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1150px\" \/><\/span><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-5\"><h3><b>1. Not Optimizing Your YouTube Profile<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your YouTube profile is the first selling point. When a prospective fan lands on your content after conducting a YouTube search or gaining interest in your content after viewing it on another social media platform, they will review your profile to determine whether they would love to come back later and view your content. If your profile is poorly presented, you would have lost a fan instantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must optimize your profile to increase the chances of gaining a subscription from a viewer who resonates with your content. After getting a new subscriber, you can progressively convert them into your OnlyFans subscriber using various lead nurturing techniques. Doing the opposite of the following when creating your YouTube profile is a mistake:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ensure that your profile picture and cover photo depict the type of content you post on OnlyFans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you post NSFW \u201cnot safe for work\u201d content on OnlyFans, avoid posting nudity on your profile and cover photo. You can use thirst trap photos that trigger a viewer to guess that you own an OnlyFans account. Thirst trap photos are sexually suggestive but not explicit and once a viewer is triggered by the photos, they are likely to check out more of your YouTube posts. That is if they are genuinely interested in the emotions evoked by your photos.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Include a brief and precise channel description with critically thought out keywords<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Let your audience know you through the description area by including details such as why you created the channel and the content a viewer should expect. Including critical details as such makes it easier for a viewer to decide whether to subscribe to your content. Using strategically placed keywords within your description allows you to be found by your target audience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use an easy, unique, and memorable name for your channel.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To make a name memorable, derive it from the type of content you create. For example, if you create cooking content, you can use <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ChefGuru <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as a username. Aligning the channel\u2019s name with the content you post increases the chances of a viewer finding your channel in case they forget the name and only have an idea of the content they would love to watch.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Create post playlists to make it simpler for your audience to follow through with your content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you have a series of posts, ensure they are categorized so that your audience can connect the dots easily when consuming the content.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Include an introduction video to inform your prospective subscriber what you post on your channel.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The introductory video should hook the viewer in by showing them a glimpse of the content they will consume on a daily basis once they subscribe.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>All the videos within your profile should have clearly defined descriptions, titles, and keywords.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doing this gives your audience peace of mind while consuming your content. They would be more satisfied when they realize that your description matches with the content in the video you have posted. If you have videos that have received a significant amount of attention in terms of likes and engagement, place them at the top of your channel to persuade your channel visitors to click. They are likely to click because likes and comments act as social proof that your content is worth watching.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to OnlyFans profile set up, YouTube\u2019s profile section is a summary of what you have to offer. It showcases your videos, playlists, community posts, channels, and about sections. Therefore, if you do not optimize it for a target audience to convince them to see value in the bigger picture, they likely will never check out what you post nor consider subscribing to your content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent YouTube from banning your account due to including your OnlyFans link, hide your link using URL (Universal Resource Locator) shorteners or other third-party link creating sites other than Linktree. Use Cash. Baby to create a page and generate a link that you can embed within your profile to direct traffic to your OnlyFans page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cash.baby\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash. Baby<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to grow your subscriber and follower count through the use of credits. Additionally, avoid including your OnlyFans link within your videos, or mentioning it so that you do not lose your account and every subscriber you have gained.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Determining Your Success Rate from the First Few Posts\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube is the second largest search engine following Google; therefore, you have access to a large audience searching for content every minute. But that does not mean your content will receive attention immediately you post it. You are making a mistake if you are frustrated over your first few videos not receiving so much attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube shorts can boost the number of views you get, but you still have to be patient. Shorts acts like TikTok, but you must find a strategy that works for your content. And, the same applies to the long-form content you post.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post at least 35 videos first before you start evaluating your YouTube success rate. Aim to start posting based on an initial content creation and posting plan. Keep going until you hit the 35<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mark and start checking the results. Posting consistently until the 35<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> video gives the YouTube algorithm time to evaluate the value-score of your videos based on your keywords and rank your content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When creating your first videos, avoid jumping on trends that give you short bursts of success. Aim to create evergreen content that is useful to the audience. The aim is to show the YouTube algorithm that your content is valuable and the keywords you have used are the most relevant. Valuable content demands engagement encouraging the YouTube algorithm to recommend your content for every keyword that matches users\u2019 searches.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep yourself motivated when you start creating YouTube content, view YouTube as a long-term venture and not as an OnlyFans fans minting firm. You can also make extra cash from YouTube once your content is monetized. Therefore, it is worth it patiently creating more videos and learning from your mistakes and other creators\u2019 mistakes while marketing your OnlyFans business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Choosing to Learn Creating Great Posts at a Slower Pace<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating content as a beginner YouTuber is frustrating when you do not know what you are doing. Some YouTubers luckily acquire more subscribers because they have a hint of what to do correctly. Relying on your mistakes and errors to progress is a mistake and can derail your growth on YouTube.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your first YouTube post should teach you what skills you lack to make converting content. These skills include thumbnail designing, audio editing, camera presence, and video editing. After creating and uploading your first YouTube videos, analyze and record the skills you have to improve to boost the quality of your videos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have the budget, invest in gaining knowledge from expert YouTube creators. They will teach you how to professionally caption your videos, develop eye-catchy thumbnails, and more. You will learn faster because the experts serve as your mentors providing you with valid knowledge from their many years of experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn from other YouTube creators. Subscribe to channels whose creators post content under the same niche as yours. Learn how they are able to get several views and comments. Evaluate the traction their first videos have had over the years. Learn how the channel edits its content for its audience and how they create a coherent story that the viewers can easily follow along. You will start seeing tremendous changes once you start learning from the veterans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of learning from others is to know how they achieve their success so that you can cut down the learning time. Do not copy what other creators are doing because your subscribers will realize it and find no value in watching copied content. Remember that OnlyFans allows you to sell exclusive content, content that one can only find on OnlyFans. That is the same theme you have to maintain within YouTube. You should serve a unique recipe despite creating content for a niche that has other creators.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn and grow faster, avoid perfection. When creating content ensure it is of high quality and with a specific objective, then proceed and post the video. Do not waste time doubting yourself and changing various aspects without hearing what your audience has to say. Post your content and go through the comment section to determine whether the viewers were satisfied with the content or not. Aim to correct varied sections of your content based on what your subscribers say. They know what suits them best.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You do not have to create content on your own. Get help from an OnlyFans agency that knows how to handle traffic hunting from other platforms. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fandafia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one such great agency hosting experts ready to help you post more content on YouTube and drive traffic to your OnlyFans page.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Posting Self-centered Content\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a model, you might be blinded by your beauty and think that is all people have to see to subscribe to your content. This assumption is wrong because posting content including your videos and photos just to show off your sexy figure and the different places you have visited does not convince people to subscribe to your content. This form of creating content for yourself is a mistake that costs you several subscribers and fans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When creating content, you must define who you are posting your content for, why you are posting it and how it will impact the people. All the content you post should hold a specific value that would coerce viewers to subscribe to your content. It is all about your audience, not you, because they are the ones who pay for your exclusive OnlyFans content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you decide who to serve, you must carve a niche for yourself. You can curve a niche from your passions or after carrying out a market value study. A niche is the topic you would want to create content around. It must be precise and have sustainable demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To target a specific demographic with precise characteristics, create a persona description. Your persona description must entail the age group, demographics, psychographics, and gender of the target audience. Having a persona description gives you an in-depth insight into what your audience would love to view.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychographics inform you how your audience thinks. Tap into their emotions to get the most out of them. By satisfying their psychological needs, you can simply convince them to subscribe to your YouTube content and eventually convert them to your loyal fans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create engaging content and take time to interact with your subscribers. OnlyFans aims to connect creators with their most loyal creators. To successfully convert your YouTube subscribers to fans, show them that you care about them and understand them. You can do this by creating content requesting for their input into which content they would love to view. Once they recommend a specific type of content, make an effort to produce it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mutual connection stems from you taking time to respond to the comments of your audience. Do not ignore the negative comments because they show you the errors you are making. Bear in mind that your audience sees the mistakes that you are unlikely to see because they know how they would love the content to be presented to them. That is why you must listen to them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite having to listen to your audience and create content, be careful not to get your account banned due to responding to comments mentioning OnlyFans. If you realize that most of your audience are commenting and inquiring about OnlyFans, avoid directly discussing and disclosing that you have an OnlyFans page. You can comment back on your Cash. Baby link and leave the conversation at that point. Some commenters are trolls trying to sabotage your YouTube account.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Not Theming Your YouTube Posts\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your objectives or better yet what unique story are you telling? Are you all over with the kind of content you make? Posting random content expecting to attract subscribers does not work on YouTube. You might gain some subscribers, though, after sometime they will realize that your content lacks direction or a specific unique story and would unsubscribe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must clearly define your aims of having a YouTube channel. Do you want to educate, entertain, or push a debate forward? Consider the niche you are creating content for to determine your objectives. Having clearly defined objectives motivates your audience to come back for more because they know what they are getting in exchange for their time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that your objectives are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Coming up with objectives having these characteristics gives you ample time strategizing on how to realize them because they are attainable. You can easily track your objectives for optimized decision making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having objectives helps you keep posting content consistently. Consistency is key if you want to keep your audience wanting more. Make it easier for your audience to determine when you will post your next video by sharing your posting schedule with them. To ensure you do not disappoint them, create more content in advance for posting during the scheduled time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using your objectives, you can proceed to make more content even after taking a break from content making. You know where you left everything at and how to proceed without disappointing the expectations of your audience. Avoid losing your subscribers by updating them earlier enough that you will take a break from content creation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"fusion-button button-flat fusion-button-default-size button-custom fusion-button-default button-3 fusion-button-default-span fusion-button-default-type\" style=\"--button_accent_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_accent_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_border_hover_color:var(--awb-color1);--button_gradient_top_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_top_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);--button_gradient_bottom_color_hover:var(--awb-custom_color_1);\" target=\"_self\" href=\"https:\/\/fandafia.com\/apply-now\/\"><span class=\"fusion-button-text fusion-button-text-right\">Make an appointment now<\/span><span class=\"fusion-button-icon-divider button-icon-divider-right\"><i class=\"icon-play-solid\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-6\"><h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3><b>6. Not Incorporating an Audience-Persuasion Strategy in Your Posts\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your content may have a genuine aim to help people but if they do not feel the vibe, they will not watch your videos. Presenting content in a boring way is a complete turn off because there is no dopamine trigger to keep enjoying the content. If you choose to create content in a generic monotonous way, you will have little to no chances of getting new subscribers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to hook your viewers in the first 2 to 3 minutes. Viewers have a short focus span and if you do not grab their attention quickly, they will click off your video. Anecdotes or scientific facts are a great way of grabbing and keeping the viewer\u2019s attention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure your video is filled with valuable content only, avoid fluff. Fluff wastes the viewers time and might disappoint them, losing them instantly. Valuable content logically solves a problem and incorporates fun and entertainment in a way that the viewer keeps watching while getting their problems solved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must know the difference between YouTube ads and actual content. Despite the requirement that YouTube ads be persuasive, avoid posting them on your channel. Post ads after allocating finances to cater for the Click Per Mille (CPM) charges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have content that did not incorporate any persuasive tactics, do not delete it. Deleting videos messes with your metrics including the number of views and watch time. Create other videos using the various persuasion techniques at your exposure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. Not Creating Search Engine Optimized (SEO) Posts\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube is a search engine and the only way prospective subscribers can find you is by using specific keywords aiming to find a video that can solve their problems. For example, if someone wants to know how to prepare a specific meal, they search using the following format:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>How to cook [Specific Meal] or Recipe for [Specific Meal]<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two statements are made up of keywords including, \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to cook \u2026 and recipe for<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d that the YouTube algorithm uses to find the most relevant content. You must create content after conducting rigorous keyword research to determine which ones have low competition but high traffic. Otherwise, you risk creating content that people cannot find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a balance between short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short-tail keywords are made up of less than 3 words while long-tail keywords are made up of more than 3 words. Short-tail keywords can fetch you tremendous traffic, but convert less. On the other hand, long-tail keywords are so precise in terms of search that they only attract relevant organic traffic and convert highly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should select a combination of short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords to boost the visibility of your channel and to get you new subscribers. Avoid using random keywords because your content might show up for irrelevant keywords when your target audience conducts searches.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>8. Posting Poor Quality Video and Photo Content<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grainy, dark, and unpleasant videos and photos. Would you love to watch such content? Well, that is the same way your audience feels when you decide to post content with poor quality as such. Visually oblique content makes it difficult for your content to consume your content. If your audience cannot view what you want them to see, how do you expect them to know that the content you have posted is worth it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producing high quality YouTube content does not have to be costly. If you cannot afford a DSLR, get a good camera phone. If you can afford it, get a phone that shoots in 4k resolution. Resolution refers to the number of pixels within your picture. The more you can have the better. Get a tripod for stability and artificial lighting sources to properly brighten your videos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current video resolution standard is Full HD (High Definition), therefore, you can create decent content using an average phone camera. Though, when shooting, avoid using the selfie camera, use the main lens because it has a greater resolution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure your videos are properly lit by using the three-point lighting technique. The technique makes use of three light sources: key light, fill light, and back light. Place the key light in front of you, the fill light on your side, and the backlight slightly raised from the back. Stay far from the backdrop if you are using one to avoid creating shadows within your videos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If possible, shoot your videos in natural light. Shoot during the morning or later afternoon hours when the sunlight is calmer and softer to get the best results. You can also shoot during a cloudy noon because the clouds filter the amount of direct light that reaches your camera allowing you to shoot high quality videos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than the visual quality of your videos, ensure the audio is crisp. Your audience may tolerate the quality of your videos, but they can never work with poor audio quality. People want to hear what you are saying. Use external microphones to record clear audio.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhance the quality of videos, photos, and audio using different editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. You can color correct your videos to enhance their outlook and tweak the audio to suit the theme of the video.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>9. Ignoring Your YouTube Posts\u2019 Metrics\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which videos received more attention than others? Why did one video do so well compared to the others? Which video has more views than others? If you cannot answer these basic questions, then you have been ignoring a crucial aspect of YouTube content creation, metrics. Metrics inform you whether you are progressing, making mistakes, or stagnant. That is why you must know what they mean and how to gain proper insight from them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Track the performance of your keywords. Create a list of short-tail and long-tail keywords you utilize for each video and track which keywords got the greatest number of subscribers and views. Keywords that get you more subscribers show you that more of your subscribers would love to see more of the content in that category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than using the inbuilt YouTube analytics tools, you can search for third party tools that provide you with more insights. For example, you also have the option to know where most of your subscribers are from allowing you to serve them better. Always monitor your post metrics to keep up with your audience&#8217;s expectations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>10. Putting Aside the Thought of Finding a Work\/Life Balance<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating content as an OnlyFans model specifically for YouTube takes focus and time because you have to create content for both Shorts and long-form content, else you risk not getting more traffic. Despite the amount of work that goes into creating such content, you should not overwhelm yourself trying to create more content. Pushing yourself too much might affect your health and lead to you not being able to consistently produce content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to recharge so that you can create content while fresh. Creating content while energized allows you to notice the mistakes you might be making. You can also respond to your subscribers\u2019 comments in a rational way because you are in the right mindset.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to walk and work out to stay fit. Interact with friends and family to have an idea of what people think about making content and life in general. You can easily gather ideas for your next video by listening to your friends and the issues they go through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To attain a better work-life balance, you can outsource your YouTube and OnlyFans account management tasks to a great agency that will take care of content posting while you only work on creating content.
